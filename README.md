# simple-messaging-server.py
Please use pycharm.

This code is the code to a simple messaging code and it will allow you to talk to anybody who are on the SAME IP
Ok, so once you have run the code with out any errors you then type in "python3 10000" then hit enter.
Now the server is up. Next need to make shure that you have telnet enabled, I did this in windows and I used pycharm. 
Next hit "Alt and F12" this will open up a terminal in pycharm. Type in "telnet" then type in your IP addres (mine was 10.0.0.10) then lastly you need to type after "telnet (Ip addres) 10000" 
A blank terminal page should open this is where you will type your message. To connect a nother computer to the net you will neet to type in to there terminal (make shure telnet is enabled) "telnet (Ip addres) 10000"
then they will be connected and now you should be a ble to type and the other person can see what you type now
